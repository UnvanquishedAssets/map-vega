VEGA INDUSTRIES: RESEARCH OUTPOST 13

	This is a pre-release from a work in progress.
	For testing purposes only. 
	
	--

	Large corporations take their research very serious. Only the
	smartest and brightest are hired, and no effort is spared
	to protect these valueable human resources from harm.

	Research Outpost 13 was probably the safest place in the universe.
	On a small planet with a harsh and frozen climate, hidden in
	an otherwise uninteresting part of the galaxy. The outpost provided
	a well-protected shelter from the hostile environment, and
	like outposts usually do, it harboured a strange sense of tranquility,
	that given enough time would drive anyone insane with boredom.

	This funny green creature was a most welcome diversion. It had hidden
	itself inside a cargo container on the monthly supply run, and when
	the scientists found it, hungry and exhausted, they couldn't resist
	but to offer the poor creature some milk and cookies.

	Kyp... a funny name for a funny creature. 

	Kyp didn't mind all the running around and neurotic button pushing.
	After all, these weren't the usual kind of scientists: they seemed
	more interested in keeping their machines running than indecently 
	prodding caged creatures with their devices.

	As usually happens in large corporations, the janitor was the first
	to notice something had gone terribly wrong. Kyp's cage hade been
	left wide open and the creature was knowhere to be found. "This is
	no place to leave little creatures wandering around", the janitor
	murmured peevishly. "And who do you think will have to clean up all
	the suprises it's going to leave behind?"

	The echo of an eerie sound interrupted his grumbling. The power
	supply had been acting weird all morning, and most of the equipment
	seemed to disagree with their blueprint specifications. "The damned
	rodent must have been shewing the cables. A few high-voltage jolts
	will teach it some manners. Serves him well." The idea almost 
	brought a smile to his face.

	Almost.

	The creature breathing down his nick wasn't green and cuddly. If
	anything, it looked like the scientists had delved too eagerly
	and too deep and had awakened something that should had been
	left alone.

	The creature on the other hand, didn't mind the janitor's ignorinace.
	It didn't even mind if this janitor was just a harmless, unarmoured
	mercenary without actual authority. A human called by any other name,
	after all, tastes just as sweet.

	The janitor's blood-stained broom hits the floor.
