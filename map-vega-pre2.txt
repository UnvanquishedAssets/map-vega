VEGA: OUTPOST 42

	This is a pre-release and the map is far from finished.
	For testing purposes only.

SKYBOX

	The Skybox was created with the personal edition of Terragen Classic
	http://www.planetside.co.uk

	I used Spirit's tutorial and skybox scripts
	http://maps.sp1r1t.org/tutorials/q3a_create_skybox/

TEXTURES

	The textures were created from pictures and edited with the Gimp.

MODELS

	The monitor model was made by f0rqu3.

	The sign model was created by Karvajalka.

	The toolcart model was made by Thorn[mDc].

	Were necessary, I edited the model textures and texture paths.

SOUNDS

	The sounds were edited with audacity. I used my own recordings
	and a number of sounds from the pdsounds collection.
