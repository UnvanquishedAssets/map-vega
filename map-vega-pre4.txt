VEGA: OUTPOST 42

	This is a pre-release and the map is far from finished.
	For testing purposes only.

SKYBOX

	The Skybox was created with the personal edition of Terragen Classic
	http://www.planetside.co.uk

	I used Spirit's tutorial and skybox scripts
	http://maps.sp1r1t.org/tutorials/q3a_create_skybox/

TEXTURES

	The textures were created from pictures and edited with the Gimp.

MODELS

	The monitor model was made by f0rqu3.
	I edited the model textures and texture paths.

	The sign model was created by Karvajalka, textures by Ingar.

	The toolcart and pump models were made by Thorn[mDc], textures by Ingar.

	The plant and container models were made by me.
SOUNDS

	The sounds were edited with audacity. I used my own recordings
