VEGA INDUSTRIES: RESEARCH OUTPOST 13

	Vega Industries
	Research Outpost 13

	Large corporations take their research very serious. Only the
	smartest and brightest are hired, and no effort is spared
	to protect these valuable human resources from harm.

	Research Outpost 13 was probably the safest place in the universe.
	On a small planet with a harsh and frozen climate, hidden in
	an otherwise uninteresting part of the galaxy, the outpost provided
	a well-protected shelter from the hostile environment. And
	like outposts usually do, it harboured a strange sense of tranquility,
	that given enough time would drive anyone insane with boredom.

	This funny green creature was a most welcome diversion. It had hidden
	itself inside a cargo container on the monthly supply run, and when
	the scientists found it, hungry and exhausted, they couldn't resist
	but to offer the poor creature some milk and cookies.

	Kyp... a funny name for a funny creature. 

	Kyp didn't mind all the running around and neurotic button pushing.
	After all, these weren't the usual kind of scientists: they seemed
	more interested in keeping their machines running than indecently 
	prodding caged creatures with their devices.

	As usually happens in large corporations, the janitor was the first
	to notice something had gone terribly wrong. Kyp's cage hade been
	left wide open and the creature was nowhere to be found. "This is
	no place to leave little creatures wandering around", the janitor
	murmured peevishly. "And who do you think will have to clean up all
	the surprises it is going to leave behind?"

	The echo of an eerie sound interrupted his grumbling. The power
	supply had been acting weird all morning, and most of the equipment
	seemed to disagree with their blueprint specifications. "That damned
	rodent must have been shewing the cables. A few high-voltage jolts
	will teach it some manners. Serves him well." The idea almost 
	brought a smile to the janitor's face.

	Almost.

	The monster breathing down his neck was far from green and cuddly. 
	If anything, it looked like the scientists had delved too eagerly
	and too deep and had awakened something that should have been
	left alone. Two seconds later, the janitor's blood-stained 
	broom hits the floor.
