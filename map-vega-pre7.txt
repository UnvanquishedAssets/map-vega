VEGA: OUTPOST 42

	This is a pre-release from a work in progress.
	For testing purposes only.

	--

	Large corporations take their research very serious. Only the
	smartest and brightest are hired, and no effort is spared
	to protect these valueable human resources from harm.

	Outpost 42 was probably the safest place in the universe. A small
	planet with harsh and frozen climate, hidden in an otherwise
	uninteresting part of the galaxy. The outpost provided
	a well-protected shelter from the hostile environment, and
	as outpost usually do, it harboured this strange sense of tranquility,
	that given enough time would drive anyone mad with boredom.

	This funny green creature was a most welcome diversion. It had hidden
	itself inside a cargo container on the monthly supply run and when
	the scientists found it, hungry and exhausted, they couldn't resist
	but to offer the poor creature some cookies and milk.

	Kyp... a funny name for a funny creature.

SKYBOX

	The Skybox was created with the personal edition of Terragen Classic
	http://www.planetside.co.uk/

	I used Spirit's tutorial and skybox scripts
